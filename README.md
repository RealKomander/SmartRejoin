**SmartRejoin** is a modern alternative to older reconnect plugins, built with a highly customizable rule-based engine.

---

## Features

- **🧠 Automatically sends players back to the server they disconnected from.
- **⚙️ Define custom rules based on a player's last server. For example, send players from a `bedwars_` game to the most populated `bedwars_lobby`.
- **⚖️ Distributes players across lobbies by connecting them to the server with the **most** or **least** players, or to a **random** one.
- **🛡️ Configure a safe fallback server (or a pool of servers) for new players or when a target server is offline.
- **🔌 A clean, well-documented `config.yml` makes setup a breeze.
- **⚡ Reload the configuration on-the-fly with a simple command—no restart required.

## Installation

1.  Download the plugin
2.  Place the plugin into your Velocity proxy's `/plugins` directory.
3.  Restart your Velocity proxy. A `config.yml` file will be generated in `/plugins/SmartRejoin/`.

## Configuration (`config.yml`)

The configuration is split into three main parts: **Fallback**, **Default Rule**, and **Custom Rules**.

### Quick Start

For the simplest setup, just install the plugin. By default (`rule: SAME`), it will automatically reconnect players to the server they left. New players will be handled by your `velocity.toml` configuration. To use the plugin's fallback for new players, set `fallback.enabled: true`.

### Example Use Cases

-   **BedWars Lobby**: If a player leaves `bedwars_12`, send them to the `bedwars_lobby` with the most players.
-   **Persistent Survival**: If a player leaves `survival`, always send them back to `survival`.
-   **Random Lobby**: If a player was in any `lobby_` server, send them to another random `lobby_` server.
-   **AFK Escape**: If a player was in an `afk` server, send them to the `lobby` with the fewest players.
